# Simple Midi Rechannelizer project
This is the code for my midi rechannelizer project.  The Midi Rechannelizer is a hardware device that is programmed to allow the user to change all incoming midi input data and output that data to a selected midi channel.

## Project components
The midi rechannelizer project uses the following components:
* Arduino Uno (or compatible clone)
* MIDI SHIELD MUSICAL BOARD FOR ARDUINO
* 8X8 RED LED DOT MATRIX MODULE FOR ARDUINO PROJECTS - for displaying midi channel
* ROTARY ENCODER MODULE FOR ARDUINO PROJECTS - for selecting the midi channel

Components were purchased here:

## Environment
This project is built with PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code instead of using the basic Arduino IDE.
